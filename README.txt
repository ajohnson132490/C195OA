How to run the program:
    To run the program, load the source files into intelliJ and hit the run button.
    From there, you can log in and use the buttons at the bottom of the window to
    navigate between appointments, customers, and reports.

Additional Report:
    The additional report I created is designed to give insight into the customer
    demographic. It displays all customers and their home country, organizing it by
    the country. This gives the company insight into who its customers are, and what
    services they may need based on location.
